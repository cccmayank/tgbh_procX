            "a": "The particles' spins are always aligned in the same direction regardless of the measurement axis.",
            "b": "The particles' spins are always anti-correlated, meaning if one is measured as 'up' along a certain axis, the other is instantly measured as 'down' along the same axis.",
            "c": "The particles' spins are randomly oriented and uncorrelated until a measurement is made on one particle, instantly collapsing the other's spin state.",
            "d": "The particles exhibit classical correlation, where their spin states were determined at the moment of entanglement but remain unknown until measured, without instantaneous influence."
